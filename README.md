# GLCM-features

My implementation of [Haralick texture features](http://haralick.org/journals/TexturalFeatures.pdf) that were not included in the `skimage` implementation of Grey-Level Co-occurence Matrix features.

It works pretty fast, especially for this quite a "Pythonic" implementation.

The features are, in essence, textural descriptors of a grey-level image. Could be used in variety of image processing tasks, such as classification, recognition, and object detection.
